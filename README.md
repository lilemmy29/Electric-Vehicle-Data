# Electric-Vehicle-Data
 Key Market Insights on Electric Vehicles

# Overview
This dataset provides valuable insights into the global Electric Vehicle (EV) market during Q2 2023. Notable trends include a significant YoY growth in Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales, with one in every 10 cars sold being a BEV. China leads the global BEV sales, followed by the USA and Germany. In the USA, BEV sales grew by almost 57% YoY, making it one of the fastest-growing EV markets.

## Vehicle Distribution by Type
The dataset predominantly consists of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) with approximately 77.65% of the total count. This indicates a substantial preference for all-electric vehicles in the market.

Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) account for approximately 22.35% of the total count. While not as prevalent as BEVs, PHEVs still represent a significant portion of the market.

## Correlation Analysis
A correlation analysis between 'electric_range' and 'base_msrp' was conducted, revealing a weak positive correlation (0.103834) between these two variables. This correlation suggests that, on average, vehicles with higher electric ranges tend to have slightly higher base prices.

## Segmentation by State (Washington, 'WA')
The analysis included a segmentation of the dataset by the state of Washington ('WA'). Within this region:

The average electric range of electric vehicles is approximately 67.86 miles, indicating that vehicles in this area typically offer a reasonable electric driving range.

The average base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for electric vehicles is approximately $1,311.10. This information can be valuable for consumers and industry stakeholders in Washington who want to gauge the expected costs of electric vehicles.
